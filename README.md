# Netflix_clone

I created this repository as a simple and basic Netflix clone using only HTML and CSS. This project is a static frontend website that visually resembles the official Netflix homepage, but it does not include any backend or JavaScript functionality. My goal was to build a beginner-friendly project that focuses on the core concepts of layout and responsive design.
